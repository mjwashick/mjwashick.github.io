## About

I'm a Continuous Quality Improvement Manager at DC Fire and Emergency Medical Services and Co-Chair of the Measure Analysis and Research Committee for the National EMS Quality Alliance (NEMSQA).

I work at the intersection of emergency medical services, systems design, and improvement science - challenging how we measure, analyze, and improve prehospital care.

My background includes an MS in Emergency Health Services with concentrations in Epidemiology and Preventative Medicine from UMBC. I publish *The EMS QI Desk* newsletter exploring systems thinking, measurement infrastructure, and operational improvement in emergency services.

## Current Work

- Building measurement frameworks for EMS quality improvement
- Analyzing systematic patterns in pain management and patient care
- Developing analytical approaches that challenge physician-dominated epistemology in EMS oversight
- Consulting with agencies on quality improvement infrastructure
