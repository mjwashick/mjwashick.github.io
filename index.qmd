# Building Measurement Infrastructure for Emergency Medical Services

I help EMS agencies move beyond dashboards and averages to understand what their data actually reveals about system performance, clinical outcomes, and operational improvement.

## About

I'm Marshall Washick - Continuous Quality Improvement Manager at DC Fire and Emergency Medical Services, Co-Chair of the Measure Analysis and Research Committee for NEMSQA, and author of *Introduction to Prehospital Analytics*.

My work challenges how the EMS industry measures performance. Most agencies rely on simple averages and generic dashboards that mask systematic problems. I build analytical frameworks that expose what's actually happening in your system - using statistical process control, improvement science, and methods that respect the complexity of prehospital care.

I hold an MS in Emergency Health Services (Epidemiology/Preventative Medicine, UMBC) and work as a practicing paramedic. I publish *The EMS QI Desk* newsletter exploring systems thinking and measurement infrastructure in emergency services.

## Book

**[Introduction to Prehospital Analytics](book.qmd)** *(in development)*

The first comprehensive guide to analytical methods for EMS systems - covering data linkage, statistical process control, improvement study design, and translating analytics into operational action. Built with R and Quarto for full reproducibility.

## Current Focus

- Analyzing systematic patterns in pain management using national NEMSIS datasets
- Building quality improvement infrastructure that challenges physician-dominated EMS epistemology  
- Consulting with agencies on measurement frameworks that drive actual improvement
- Developing analytical approaches for operational performance beyond response time averages
